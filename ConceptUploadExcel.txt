How can I change the appearance of this to be like a box with a file icon in the middle with a label that says 

Drag files here to upload them.

or choose your files.


Is it possible for us to have the functionality that when a file is chosen or drag and dropped into the upload box it displays a loading bar while it processes the kind of processing type it is and then displays it in a Queue column off to the write with the file name and then Upload Process next to it.


The goal would be to be able to upload multiple Excel files process and store the data depending on its processing type. And then when you click on a button with a magnifying glass it displays a modal with a preview of the data.
